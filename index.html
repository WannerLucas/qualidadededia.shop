<p>Ela há alguns anos atrás já tinha iniciado esse método de emagrecimento por enzimas, esse segredo foi guardado por muitos anos por médicos com atendimentos caríssimos, era inteiramente exclusivo para alta sociedade.
</p>
<p>A Enzima deveria ser aplicada em seu corpo como uma forma de derreter sua gordura localizada.

</p>
<p>De acordo com o estudo feito por cientistas da Universidade da Califórnia, em São Diego, a enzima TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), é a responsável por fazer esse procedimento natural acontecer, e também a única e melhor forma em 2022 de perder peso de forma natural, sem agredir seu corpo e não precisar passar semanas em uma cama de hospital.

<p>How more and more guys are flunking out of college… </p>

<p>I could see the rising power of women as a <strong class="accent">CURSE</strong>… </p>

<h2 class="left caps condensed">2. I could blame <strong class="accent">myself…</strong></h2>

<p>Today? It&rsquo;s <strong class="accent">over 7 BILLION</strong> (and it&rsquo;s headed for 10 Billion by 2050)… .</p>
<p>So, ask yourself, <strong class="accent">if women don’t like sex,</strong> how the heck did the population of the world DOUBLE in <strong class="accent">just 50 years? </strong></p>
<p>Why did &ldquo;50 Shades Of Grey&rdquo; <strong class="accent">soak the panties</strong> of hundreds of millions of women around the world? </p>

<h3 class="left">2. Women have been taught that only <strong class="accent">SLUTS</strong> want sweaty, passionate, animalistic sex with men.</h3>
<p>And admitting what every cell in her body yearns for could <strong class="accent">destroy her reputation</strong> and <strong class="accent">could even ruin her life…</strong> if word gets around or it gets out on social media.</p>

<p>Fear of rejection and shame alone are enough to keep most women&rsquo;s legs sealed closed with <strong class="accent">emotional super-glue.</strong></p>
<p>And to make hot girls VERY careful about how they choose the men they <strong class="accent">sexually surrender</strong> themselves to…</p>
<p>Which brings us to the third reason (the most <strong class="accent"><em>important</em></strong> of them all)… </p>

<h3 class="left">3. To avoid rejection… to avoid being JUDGED… When it comes to <strong class="accent">sex</strong> and <strong class="accent">lust</strong> and <strong class="accent">connection</strong> and <strong class="accent u">pure physical pleasure</strong>… </h3>

<h3>The fact is, knowing this &ldquo;Secret Sexual Language&rdquo; lets you tune in to a woman&rsquo;s <strong class="accent">“Sexual Broadcast”</strong> and follow the signal back to carnal delights beyond even the most pornographic imagination.</h3>
<p>Now, <span class="hi">I didn’t discover this <strong class="accent">Language Of Lust</strong> by accident… </span></p>
<p>It was the <strong class="accent">Holy Grail</strong> at the end of a personal mission that took me <strong>years</strong> to complete as I learned and tested and tried again and again with dozens and dozens of amazing girls… </p>
<p>All while watching more and more guys who didn&rsquo;t know <strong class="accent">this secret</strong> bathe in an endless stream of <span class="u">rejection</span> and <span class="u">anger</span> and <span class="u">shame</span>… </p>
<p>Accomplishing <strong class="accent">my mission</strong> to <strong class="accent">learn the secrets</strong> of female <strong class="accent">lust</strong> was <strong class="accent">difficult</strong> and <strong class="accent">even painful</strong>…</p>
<p>After weeks of digging, I found a <strong class="accent">romance novel millionaire</strong> on a forum, called her up, and discovered the incredible &ldquo;<strong class="accent">Primal Ravishment Fantasy</strong>&rdquo; secretly carried around by &ldquo;good girls&rdquo; all over the world.</p>
<p>I went to Las Vegas and interviewed a <strong class="accent"><span class="u">straight</span> professional male prostitute…</strong></p>
<p>I was shocked at how <strong class="accent">out-of-shape</strong> and <strong class="accent">normal-looking</strong> he was…</p>
<h3>But this <span class="hi">fat little gigolo</span> taught me the <strong class="accent">“Fort Knox Phrase”</strong> that had women ripping open their purses and <strong class="accent"><em>PAYING</em> to have sex with him</strong> while<span class="hi"> so many other guys can’t get laid to save their lives</span></h3>
<p>I got five of my best female friends <strong class="accent">drunk</strong> and <em>listened like my life depended on it…</em></p>
<p>As they went into <strong class="accent">EXQUISITE DETAIL</strong> about the <em>many</em> times they &ldquo;dropped the good girl act&rdquo;… </p>
<p>And gave a random dude <strong class="accent">the ride of his life</strong> <em>(while forcing the &ldquo;nice&rdquo; guys they were dating to WAIT for weeks and weeks just to get half a hand job.)</em></p>
<p>What <strong>shocked me even more</strong> was when they told me about all the times they <strong class="accent">WANTED</strong> to go home with a guy… </p>
<p>And were devastated when he didn&rsquo;t know the &ldquo;<strong class="accent">Passion Password</strong>&rdquo; which wouldlet her finally drop the act, cut loose and give in to her urgent sexual need.</p>
<p>I interviewed psychology professors, sat in on a women&rsquo;s studies course, read <strong class="accent">SMUT</strong> written by women, learned &ldquo;<strong class="accent">Linguistic Triggers</strong>&rdquo; women <span class="u">refuse</span> to ignore… </p>

<h3 class="flushbottom">And then, with all of this &ldquo;<strong class="accent">sexual magic</strong>&rdquo; buzzing around in my brain I sat down at my laptop and boiled EVERYTHING I&rsquo;d learned and discovered into… </h3>
<h1 class="condensed huge flushbottom flushtop caps accent">33 powerful tricks, techniques &amp; phrases</h1>
<h3>Which wake up the <strong class="accent">animal</strong> in a woman, make her <strong class="accent">feel safe</strong> and <strong class="accent">open</strong> with you (and only you) and <strong class="accent">fixes her sexual hunger on you...</strong> right where it belongs. </h3>
<p>Sitting exhausted at my desk I looked at what I&rsquo;d created…  </p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;book&rdquo; or a &ldquo;course&rdquo; or anything like that…</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sectionouter section2 clearfix whitewrap">
    <div class="sectioninner clearfix">
  <p>It was a survival guide for regular guys to live, get laid and get a girlfriend (if you want) in the devastated ruins of the sexual revolution… </p>

<h2>I'd created an &ldquo;Owner&rsquo;s Manual&rdquo; for a woman&rsquo;s most important <strong class="accent">erogenous zone</strong>… </h2>
<h1 class="caps huge condensed flushbottom flushtop">Her <strong class="accent">Mind</strong> &amp; Her <strong class="accent">Imagination</strong> </h1>
<p>It took me a few weeks to put my &ldquo;<strong class="accent">Manual</strong>&rdquo; to the test…</p>
<p>A few weeks to run into <strong class="accent u">her</strong> again… </p>
<h3>The beautiful brunette in the <strong class="accent"><em>tight</em></strong> yoga pants… </h3>
<p>The girl I thought had been <em>flirting</em> with me but who had SCREAMED to protect her reputation when I stupidly made <strong class="accent">the <span class="u">wrong</span> move… </strong></p>
<p>I was <strong class="accent">smarter</strong> this time… </p>
<p>I saw her in a park near where I live in <em>tight</em> pants and an <strong class="accent">industrial-strength sports bra</strong> creating an epic canyon of cleavage…</p>
<p>She had her mat laid out… her fantastic ass in the air as she held <strong class="accent">Downward Facing Dog.</strong></p>
<p>I made sure not to get too close… not to approach her and say something <strong class="accent">stupid</strong> like some pickup artist… </p>
<p>I sat down on a bench 10-feet away and <strong class="accent">admired</strong> her astonishing body… </p>
<p>I imagined my tongue on that little spot where her hip and leg connected…</p>

<p>She was glistening with sweat when she <strong class="accent">finished</strong> what she was doing and looked my way… </p>
<p>There was a <strong class="accent">moment</strong> of recognition… a <strong class="accent">moment</strong> where she wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do… a moment of… apology? </p>
<p>A moment when things could go very right or very, very wrong… </p>
<p>I took a <strong class="accent">deep</strong> breath.</p>
<p>I felt dizzy, <strong class="accent">scared</strong> like I was jumping off a bridge and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the bungie cord was tight… but in a totally casual tone, <strong class="accent">I said it… </strong></p>
<h3>The <strong class="accent">Lust Mirror</strong> phrase I&rsquo;d discovered. </h3>
<p>My wrists itched suddenly, flashing back to the feeling of <strong class="accent">handcuffs</strong>… </p>
<p><strong>But I knew it </strong><strong class="accent">worked…</strong></p>
<p>When her pupils <strong class="accent">dilated</strong>…</p>
<p>When her nipples <strong class="accent">hardened</strong>…</p>
<p>When her hips <strong class="accent">tilted</strong> towards me…</p>
<p>When she <strong class="accent">smiled</strong>…</p>
<p>She wiggled over to me… sat down on the bench to put her shoes on… </p>
<p>Inches away so I could <strong class="accent">feel her heat…</strong> inhale that intoxicating <strong class="accent">smell</strong> of her.</p>
<p>She forgot to tie her shoes as we talked for almost an hour, in low voices like <strong class="accent">lovers</strong>… Me whispering the little tricks and techniques I&rsquo;d created, her inching <strong class="accent">closer and closer</strong> until her foot hooked around mine like a hug or an invitation…</p>
<h1>And then <strong class="accent u">she</strong> made the move…</h1>
<p>Her hand on my thigh… her lips against <strong class="accent">mine</strong>… her tongue snaking its way into <strong class="accent u">my</strong> mouth, her body writhing against <strong class="accent">me</strong> desperate to have <strong class="accent">me</strong> inside. </p>
<p><strong>In the hours we spent together </strong>I took <strong class="accent">control</strong> of her fantasies… </p>
<p>Whispered <strong class="accent">naughty</strong> words in her ear that made goosebumps rise on her back…</p>
<p>Stroked her ego, teased her, made her feel <strong class="accent">feminine</strong> and <strong class="accent">open</strong> and <strong class="accent">vulnerable</strong> and <strong class="accent">safe to unleash her passion</strong> with no fear of being judged or rejected … </p>
<h2>And in return she <strong class="accent">surrendered <span class="u">everything</span></strong> to me… </h2>
<p>She tore down all her walls… opened herself to me… <strong class="accent">begged</strong> to fulfill my fantasies (and me to fulfill hers)… </p>
<p>Gave me <strong class="accent">intense</strong> pleasure again and again that lit every cell of my body on <strong class="accent">fire</strong> and left me exhausted and satisfied and happy and <strong class="accent">feeling like a man</strong> in a way I never thought I could feel. </p>
<p>At one point she gasped <strong class="accent">“I love you”</strong> as she came… I knew she didn&rsquo;t mean it. I knew she meant <strong class="accent">she loved how I was making her feel…</strong> she loved that she could completely <strong class="accent">be a woman</strong> with me. </p>
<h3><strong class="accent">The next morning</strong> we woke up in a tangle of damp sheets and smiles… </h3>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what came over me,&rdquo; she sighed as she stretched <strong class="accent">contentedly</strong>…</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a <em>slut</em> or anything, you know. I don&rsquo;t usually do that sort of thing. There was just something <strong class="accent">irresistible</strong> about you. I couldn&rsquo;t help myself.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I smiled wolfishly at her excuse. Grabbed her ass. Thought about when <strong class="accent">I’d let her</strong> get it again.</p>

  <img alt="product-shot" class="product-shot" src="https://languageoflust.com/images/product-shot.jpg">

<h2 class="product-subhead">The result of over 5 years of non-stop, intensive research, glorious in-person testing and work… </h2>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<p><strong class="accent">Work I did to give women the ecstasy</strong> so many idiots in the world tell them they&rsquo;re not &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to have…</p>
<p>See, the <strong class="accent">Language of Lust</strong> isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;course&rdquo; or an &ldquo;educational program&rdquo; where I tell you to change who you are to attract women…</p>
<p>Instead, it&rsquo;s a collection of <span class="u">almost-magical</span> <span class="u">done-for-you</span> techniques which <strong class="accent">automatically</strong> bore deeply into the mind of any woman you use them on and <strong class="accent">activate her pure, unbridled LUST</strong> on command and just by saying a few words. </p>
<p>The men who have used <strong class="accent">The Language of Lust</strong> so far say thatit&rsquo;s like a <strong class="accent">Nuclear Bomb in the battle of the sexes…</strong> </p>
<p>A completely unfair <span class="u">weapon</span> which gives you <strong class="accent">incredible sexual <span class="u">power</span> over women</strong> even if they completely ignore you now. </p>
<p>And positions you to be <strong class="accent">the one guy</strong> in your city who truly knows how to <strong class="accent">turn her on</strong> and give her <strong class="accent">permission to give in to her <span class="u">secret desires</span>. </strong></p>
<h2>Here&rsquo;s just a <strong class="accent">tiny sample</strong> of the secrets you&rsquo;re going to learn and the <strong class="accent">amazing results</strong> you&rsquo;re going to almost-automatically get when you discover <strong class="accent u">The Language of Lust</strong> today… </h2>
<h3>The<strong class="accent"> Pavlov’s Panty Drencher </strong>Technique… </h3>
<p>Use this to condition a woman to become <strong class="accent">unreasonably turned on</strong> and quiver with desire for you <strong>every time you whisper a seemingly innocent phrase of your choice</strong> in her ear… </p>
<p><strong class="accent">Warning</strong>: Using this in public has been known to draw stares from other men in the room as she immediately <strong class="accent">soaks</strong><strong> her panties,</strong> ruins her chair, and <strong class="accent">gasps</strong> like she&rsquo;s just run a sexual marathon.</p>
<p>Next you&rsquo;ll learn…</p>
<h3>How to tickle her <strong class="accent">Emotional G-Spot </strong></h3>
<p>so she BEGS to be <strong class="accent">your</strong> personal slut while turning other guys down and insisting she&rsquo;s &ldquo;not that kind of girl&rdquo; to everyone but you. </p>
<p>Doing this turns all her distaste and shame around the word &ldquo;slut&rdquo; into <strong class="accent">white-hot lust</strong><strong> aimed directly at you.</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel like you have <strong class="accent">sexual super-powers</strong> when you learn this next one… </p>
<h3>I call it <strong class="accent">The Lust Mirror</strong> Technique… </h3>
<p>This method is so easy to do to a woman, but so <strong class="accent">powerful</strong>… </p>
<p>It allows you to create a <strong class="accent">feedback loop</strong> of ravenous lust between you and a girl…</p>
<p> Where the more <strong class="accent">turned on</strong> you are, the more <strong class="accent">turned on</strong> she gets… </p>
<p>Until she&rsquo;s <strong class="accent">aching for you</strong> with sexual desperation, pulling you by the belt to the bedroom and staring at you like a  hungry lioness who just stumbled upon a porterhouse steak. </p>
<p>Ever wish you just had a <strong class="accent">Remote Control</strong><strong> for her sex drive?</strong></p>
<h3>You&rsquo;ll discover the secret power of <strong class="accent">Pleasure Resistance</strong>… &nbsp;</h3>
<p>And exactly what to say and do when she&rsquo;s &ldquo;not in the mood&rdquo; to have her <strong class="accent">gushing</strong>, <strong class="accent">spreading her legs</strong> and <strong class="accent">breathing heavy</strong> in seconds.</p>
<h3>The <strong class="accent">Kink Exposure</strong> Method </h3>
<p>Allows you to discover her deepest, most hidden fantasies <strong class="accent">as easily as taking a picture</strong> on your cell phone… </p>
<p> <strong class="accent">IMPORTANT: </strong>Use this method and you&rsquo;ll know things about her sexual desires she might be <strong class="accent">SCARED</strong> to admit herself… which is why I&rsquo;m also going to teach you how to awaken a woman to her hidden sexuality without even a hint of guilt or shame. </p>
